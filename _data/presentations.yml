# Presentations for the 2020 Back to the Mac conference

- title: Using Vision and Combine to Search for Text in Screenshots
  description: I’m the creator of Screenie a Mac app to search for text in your screenshots. The core of the app is already open source. My talk will walk you through the text request Vision APIs, and how we can efficiently create an index for a large number of images in Swift using Combine, including code examples from Screenie. I’ll demonstrate how to improve search result accuracy using natural language concepts including tokenization, lemmatization, and data detection - all provided by the NaturalLanguage framework. Last, I’ll cover some new APIs added in macOS 11 for sentence embeddings which we can use to cluster similar screenshots. By the end of the talk, attendees will know how to use high level ML and NLP APIs on macOS to create an efficient image search.

- title: Using XPC to execute Python code in your Mac app
  description: This presentation will discuss using XPC to create a Python interpreter environment within your Mac application, including describing why you’d want a python interpreter in the first place, why you would benefit by using XPC, and how to establish bi-directional data links. Finally, I’ll discuss the results I observed doing this in my app, Cartographica.
